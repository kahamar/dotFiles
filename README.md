### dotFiles

My collection of dot and config files. Highly optimised for OS X 10.9 and higher, Ubuntu Server 12.04 and higher. ZSH, tmux, VIM, Chef, Vagrant, Docker, CoreOS and many more.
A lot update for OS X 10.11

### Installation

`
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stonevil/dotFiles/master/install.sh | /bin/bash -s --

### TODO

* rebuild update procedure to become not depended on dotfiles-update-all (idea with aray)
* rebuild install procedure to be self-deployed
